I am a creature who lives by the weather,
who walks with a soft tread upon the ground.
Eyes keen in darkness. Ears of a sharpness.

Often sought after, but rarely found.

Now I've come to burn it down! (Look where you have ended up! ended up!)

Dreamed of an empire, sick with a canker,
foretold the disaster that it breeds.
Chain reaction, sweet distraction,
You meddle in places you should not be.

Now I've come to burn it down! (Look where you have ended up! ended up!)

I have met you before, but I think this time you will remember.
I have met you before, but I think this time you will remember.
I have met you before, but I think this time you will remember.
I have met you before, but I think this time you will remember.
